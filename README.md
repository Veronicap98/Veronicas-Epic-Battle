## Introduction

Hi, I'm Veronica, and thanks for checking out my repo! I am a new, self-taught programmer with her eye on game development. This project is nothing more than just a tool for me to practice my skills on and apply new concepts and techniques as I learn them and to give me some hands-on experience outside of tutorials. 

I will continue expanding this project, enhancing the experience and making it more interesting as I learn and grow as a programmer. I intend for this to be a gateway into my first full game. 

The program is made in Godot game engine. You can build it yourself by just opening the project in Godot and exporting it. Please note that the source code includes an .exe of the program as it exists in the current state of the source code; the .exe can be moved and run anywhere as it is completely standalone, I just keep it there for convenience.

Please, feel free to look over the code and let me know what you think. Advice, constructive criticism, and ideas are all welcome. Thank you and have a great day! :)
